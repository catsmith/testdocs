Standalone Collation Editor
===========================

The standalone version of the collation editor works with the local file system on
your computer. A small example of a single Greek verse is included as a sample file.

The collation editor is a GUI wrapper around `collateX <https://collatex.net/>`_. A version of that software is included
with the standalone collation editor.
